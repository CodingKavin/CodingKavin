- 👋 Hi, I’m Kavin
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science. I have a degree in Civil Engineering but have been working in Finance for the last 4 years. I recently became very interested in
      data science and I'm building my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking the Data Science program at Ryerson and looking to build some projects to showcase.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data sets right now with anyone who is on the same boat as me or someone with a little more experience, I've got some experience with python, R, SQL from completing the Ryerson program and looking to build on it.
- 📫 How to reach me: kavinp622@gmail.com
