- 👋 Hi, I’m Kavin
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science. I have a degree in Civil Engineering but have been working in Finance for the last 4 years. I recently became veery interested in
      data science and I'm building my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking the Data Science program at Ryerson and looking to build some projects to showcase since I am completely new to this.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data sets from Kaggle right now with anyone who is on the same boat as me or someone with a little more experience. I will
      be taking a machine learning course on my own next semester outside of the program but right now my skills are still at building the fundamentals
